            <h2>Week 2:</h2>
            <p>10 June 24 : Recurrent Neural Networks and decided to work on the project based on Swarm Robotics and Deep Reinforcement Learning.<br>
                11 June 24 : Given with two research papers on Deep Reinforcement Learning (Attached in this repository) and told to learn the basics of deep learning (started doing that).<br>
                12 June 24: Continued with learning basics of Deep learning and Supervised Learning.<br>
                13 June 24 : Started with studying research paper on " Decentralized Multi-Agent Pursuit Using Deep Reinforcement Learning " .<br>
                14 June 24 : Analysis of Second Research Paper on  " Game of Drones: Multi-UAV Pursuit-Evasion Game With Online Motion Planning by Deep Reinforcement Learning ".</p>

        <section id="week3" class="section">
            <h2>Week 3:</h2>
            <p>17 June 14 : Learned about "Pygame" to create simulation environment for our project.<br>
                18 June 24 : Made Presentations for our research paper as a testimony (Attached in the repo.)<br>
                19 June 24 : Were given a website link to analyse, study and implement a sample simulation environment using pygame. Link : https://medium.com/agents-and-robots/a-multi-agent-system-in-python-74701f256c3a<br>
                20 June 24 : Were given the task to analyse the action space and state space of the research paper and told to make chamges in the simulation created before as per the research papers.<br>
                21 June 24 : Sterted learning and understanding about the simulation environment and started doing changes in it as per the paper.

            <h2>Week 4:</h2>
            <p>24 June 24 : Analysed the Action space , state space and rewarding in paper 1 and created a simulation for the same.<br>
               25 June 24 : Started studying and analysing the Implementation of DRL in paper 1 and trying to avoid collisions between evadors as well between pursuers and evadors.<br>
               26 June 24 : Created a simulation that avoided collisons within evadors as well as collisions with agents and evadors using direct approach.<br>
               27 June 24 : Trying to implement the DRL approaches like DDPG and PPO to avoid collisons.<br>
